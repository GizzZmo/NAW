## Licensing FAQ

### Q: Can I use the open-source version for commercial music?
**A**: No. While the MIT license allows broad usage, it excludes commercial deployment. If you plan to sell music created with NAW, you need a commercial license.

### Q: What happens if I create music with open-source NAW, then later sell it?
**A**: You must retroactively purchase a commercial license before monetizing. We offer a grace period for indies (contact us).

### Q: Can I train my own models and use them commercially?
**A**: Yes, if you train models on licensed data. Our commercial license covers the NAW software, not your custom models.

### Q: Do I need a license if I'm a hobbyist releasing free music?
**A**: No. Free, non-monetized releases are covered under MIT. Donations/Patreon are considered commercial.

### Q: Can I use NAW to generate stock music for libraries?
**A**: Yes, with a **Professional Studio** license (Tier 2+). Tier 1 covers direct releases only.

### Q: What about YouTube monetization?
**A**: YouTube ad revenue counts as commercial. You need a license (Tier 1 sufficient for individual channels).

### Q: Can I cancel my commercial license?
**A**: Yes, but you lose access to updates and support. Music created during the license period remains yours.

### Q: Are there student discounts?
**A**: Yes, 50% off Tier 1 for verified students. Educational institutions: contact for custom pricing.
