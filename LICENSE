This software uses the following open-source packages:

- **React** (MIT License)
- **TypeScript** (Apache License 2.0)
- **Vite** (MIT License)
- **Lucide React** (ISC License)

### AI Model Licensing

**Important Notice for Commercial Use:**

The current implementation uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for semantic planning. 
This is for prototyping purposes only. For production/commercial use:

1. Review Gemini API Terms of Service
2. Consider training proprietary models with licensed data
3. Ensure compliance with "Fairly Trained" standards

Future neural models (DAC, Flow Matching) must use **permissive licenses** 
(Apache 2.0, MIT) for commercial deployment. Models with CC-BY-NC licenses 
(e.g., MusicGen, Stable Audio Open) require separate commercial licensing 
agreements.

### Attribution

This project is inspired by research from:
- Meta AI (MusicGen, EnCodec)
- Stability AI (Stable Audio)
- Descript (DAC Codec)
- Google Research (Gemini, Flow Matching)
